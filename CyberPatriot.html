        <p>The students The competition puts teams of high school and middle school students in the position of newly hired IT professionals tasked with managing the network of a small company. In the rounds of competition, teams are given a set of virtual images that represent operating systems and are tasked with finding cybersecurity vulnerabilities within the images and hardening the system while maintaining critical services in a six hour period. Teams compete for the top placement within their state and region, and the top teams in the nation earn all-expenses paid trips to Baltimore, MD for the National Finals Competition where they can earn national recognition and scholarship money.

            All rounds of competition in CyberPatriot, with the exception of the National Finals Competition, take place online. Teams may compete from any location; many participate at their school, organization, or public library. Competitions take place on specified weekends throughout the school year. Teams must complete all their work during one (1) six consecutive-hour period on the Friday, Saturday, or Sunday of these competition windows. They may only have one instance of an image open at a time.

                    <p>Basic Windows security is a major component of the CyberPatriot competition. Windows operating systems include desktops, servers, and embedded systems. While Windows operating systems heavily use graphical user interfaces (GUIs), they all still have a command-line shell. Earlier XP-based operating systems (Windows XP and Windows Server 2003) only had the command prompt (cmd.exe), and later versions also have the Powershell</p>
