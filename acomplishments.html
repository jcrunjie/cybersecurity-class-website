            <p>During my years at Monroe Technology Center as a special education teacher, I had the privilege of working with CST students. For many of those students, this was their first experience in a learning environment designed in a business-like setting. Rather than the typical read-the-text and listen-to-the-lecture course, CST uses hands-on activities with a computer station assigned specifically to each student. Those who feel more comfortable working independently may work alone while those who prefer teamwork can try that avenue as a means of absorbing material. Students work in teams for projects and competitions, make group or independent presentations to teach content, and analyze and solve problems through troubleshooting experiences. Students may move around the room to ask questions or to seek insights from others as desired. Competencies can be demonstrated using realistic situations, and because the approach to this class is so respectful and open-minded, the students openly prefer Monroe days to their traditional school days. They have enrolled in a course designed to achieve professional knowledge using tactics often associated with college or adult learning environments. Learning specialized knowledge “by choice” is a refreshing way to earn high school (and college) credits.</p>

            <p>As the school year progresses, students find areas of preference. Their plans and their resumes develop as a result. Soon they are earning certifications applicable to higher education. While no two students plan identical paths, all advance their skills in building computers, using information technology, speaking in public, writing technically, and preparing for other workplace expectations during just this one school year. Many will participate in summer internships over the following summer, earning salaries that reflect a skill level not paralleled by most of their peers.</p>

            <p>The CST program is the first step for many students in making personal choices that can lead to prolific careers in Information Technology, an area of great need in our present-day job market. Acceptance into this program can lead to opportunities beyond a student’s original intent, and the best part is that it’s FREE to our students in the Loudoun County Public Schools</p>

            <h3>School</h3>
            <p>My name is Samantha Tansley. I was a part of the 2014-2015 CST class at Monroe Technology Center
                (MTC). My homeschool was Woodgrove HS and I was a senior when attending MTC. During senior year, I
                began taking Northern Virginia Community College (NOVA) classes through the dual enrollment program
                offered at both my home school and MTC. In the spring I also took an additional NOVA class on my own.
                After graduating I continued to take classes every semester (including summer) at NOVA. I have only
                taken one semester off since graduation. In October of 2018, I transferred to Strayer University to
                complete my degree. As they have 4 quarters rather than semesters, I am on track to graduate with a
                Bachelor’s in Business Administration in December of 2019. I also have two Career Studies Certificates
                from NOVA for Business Information Technology and Leadership Development. They were awarded in
                May of 2016.</p>
            <h3>Work</h3>
            <p>I graduated HS in 2015 and started an internship at Time Warner Cable (TWC) in Herndon, VA. I worked
                as a NOC intern for 6 months, then applied to be full time. I worked at Time Warner Cable for a year
                until we were bought out by Charter Communications. I left Charter/TWC to work in the Reston Town
                Center as Assistant Manager at Paper Source. I worked there for a year before taking a couple of months
                off to reevaluate my goals and focus on school. I started working part time at 1757 Golf Club in October
                of 2017 and a few months later in January of 2018 I began working full time at DSI. I am still at both jobs
                while also going to school full time. My newest business venture is that I will be opening an Etsy shop
                next week (Friday, March 22 nd ) called Tansley Paper Co.</p>
            <h3>Personal</h3>
            <p>I have supported myself through higher education by working full-time and not taking out loans. I
                moved out of my parent’s house in May of 2016. I own my own car and have my own one bedroom
                apartment in Ashburn.</p>
            <h3>Accomplishments in CST</h3>
            <p>On our first day of Computer Systems Technology (CST) in 2014 our teacher, Lorna Garner, told us it was
                her last day. We had a substitute teacher for the first 3 months. In November, Jeremy Staples came in to
                save the day. It was a rocky start, but with the help of one of the best teacher’s assistant he was able to
                get us back on track. I helped organize the room, create all the Quizlets, and print out study material. In
                turn, Staples helped me put together a killer resume and cover letter, which landed me the job at TWC.
                Since then, he has been my go to reference when applying for jobs. I was also a part of one of the finalist
                teams in our Cyber Patriot competition, I don’t recall the placement level or the name of our group. CST
                at MTC had such a great impact on my life that when my little sister was a senior, she attended as well.</p>
            <h3>Current/Future Plans and Goals</h3>
            <p>Currently, I am working on wrapping up my Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration in December. I
                work full time as a Federal Sales Account Representative at DSI. Also, I work part-time at 1757 Golf Club
                in the Pro Shop as well as a Banquet Server. Next Friday, March 22 nd , I am launching my Etsy shop
                (Tansley Paper Co.) which will focus on handmade cards and other paper crafts. My goal is to have a
                sustainable online business that can support me on its own or with a supplemental part-time job.</p>

            <p class="people">Joseph Evans </p>
            <p>I was a student in the 2015-2016 MTC CST program. This was my second year at Monroe, taking
                the Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) class previously. I wanted to expand my horizons and
                give myself multiple job paths that I could take. I had always had an interest in computers,
                being the computer repair man in my family. This class allowed me to vastly expand my
                knowledge on computer hardware and repair, which resulted in the earning of my CompTIA A+
                Certification.</p>
            <p>Upon completion of our A+, we were presented with the opportunity at an internship at Time
                Warner Cable. I was fortunate enough to get offered a position in their Network Operating
                Center. I began working there as a part time employee just over a week after I had graduated
                high school. Thanks to this job, I was able to get my very first car. I worked at Time Warner up
                until the office’s relocation in early 2017.</p>
            <p>Fast forward to August of 2017, I was offered a full-time position for Prince William County
                Public Schools as a Technical Support Specialist. I was 19 at the time of hire. My ideal job was to
                work in IT for a school system, so you can imagine my excitement when I got the call offering
                me the position. Due to this job, I was making enough to be able to move out and marry my
                then girlfriend of over 4 years. We will have been married a year this June.</p>
            <p>None of this would’ve been possible had it not been for CST. Having my A+ opened so many
                doors for me in my life, as well as laying the groundwork for more things to come. Not to
                mention all the friends that I met that I still am in contact with. Now that life has settled down,
                my next step is to work towards getting my Network+ and Security+. I am currently more than
                satisfied in my current position and do not see myself changing jobs anytime soon. Although I
                won’t lie and say I haven’t considered become a teacher sometime down the line. All that to
                say, CST has changed my life completely. Where I am now can be traced directly back to this
                class, and given the choice, I would not change a thing.</p>

                Technology class I learned technical terminology and hands-on skills. In general, I learned professional
                skills such as interviewing and resume building. I was truly set up for success after graduation.”
